  "Parser tests against a REAL Google Patents page.

  The fixture is `test/toshokan_patents/fixtures/US8697359B1.html` — the live
  page for the Broad Institute CRISPR-Cas9 patent, reduced to its `<title>` and
  its 2,329 `<meta>` tags (the parser reads nothing else). It is a real page,
  not a hand-written minimal one, because the bugs this parser can have are
  bugs about SCALE and ORDER: a `name`/`scheme` pair that only conflates on a
  page carrying both, an attribute order that only appears once in a thousand
  tags. A three-tag fixture proves nothing about those.

  These tests are `.cljc` and run on BOTH platforms on purpose — `parse-html` is
  the pure half of the library, and 'pure' is a claim about platform agreement,
  not a comment."
