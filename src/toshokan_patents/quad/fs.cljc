  "The journal's FILE legs — everything `toshokan-patents.quad` deliberately is not.

  Split out 2026-08-10. `quad` claimed in its docstring that its top half was
  pure and portable, and then required `node:fs` at the top of the namespace for
  the legs at the bottom. A comment cannot enforce that; a namespace boundary
  can. The moment a Cloudflare Worker tried to use the pure half — the codec,
  the whole reason this is a library — the build failed on a filesystem
  dependency the Worker does not have and does not want.

  Consumers with a filesystem (the JVM actor, nbb scripts) require this.
  Consumers without one (Workers, browsers) require only `quad` and are
  unaffected by anything in here."
